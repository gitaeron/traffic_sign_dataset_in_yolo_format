# About this project

This project is a dataset of road traffic signs (straight, left turn, and right turn) created in the YOLO universal format.

The folder directories are as follows:

- straight_only - dataset of straight traffic signs
    - train - 3366
    - val - 841

- turn_left - dataset of left turn traffic signs
    - train - 2000
    - val - 500

- turn_right - dataset of right turn traffic signs
    - train - 2000
    - val - 500

- mix - multiple classifications in a single image
    - train - 2406
    - val - 601

- `total` - Integrate all samples.
    - train 9772
    - val 2442

- code - code related to dataset processing

In the `straight_only`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right` folders, each image only contains the current category represented by the folder. In other words, the dataset in the `straight_only` folder only includes the `straight_only` traffic sign and its annotation and will not include any other classifications.

In the `mix` folder, each image contains two or more traffic signs from the `straight_only`, `turn_left`, and `turn_right` categories.

In the `total` folder, all types of sample data are integrated for direct use in training, eliminating the need for additional operations.

For more information, please check the difference between the straight_only/images and mix/images folders.

## Directory structure

The folder structure of this dataset is as follows:

- straight_only
    - images
        - train
        - val
    - labels
        - train
        - val
    - classes.txt

The directory structure of the three folders 'straight_only', 'turn_left', and 'turn_right' are the same.

---

## Categories

There are three classes in the 'classes' section:

- straight_only
- turn_left
- turn_right

## dataset.yaml

The basic content is included in it. If you want to use it directly, please modify the 'path' to the relative or absolute path of your project.

> According to the official tutorial of yolov8, you can place this file anywhere. Just specify data=dataset.yaml in CLI or Python program.

---

## code

This folder contains the code written by myself when processing the dataset. Currently, two files are provided:

- random_dataset.py
    - This program divides dataset images in an 80%/20% ratio.

- rename.py
    - This program renames image and label files in a fixed format.

Regardless of which file is used, please make sure to modify it appropriately based on your understanding before using it.
